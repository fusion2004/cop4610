We created a test program that calls both of our created system
calls. We ran this test program in both implementations of the
SLOB: best-fit and first-fit. We ran this test program several
times until we arrived at values of 500 bytes claimed. This was
useful in keeping consistency while comparing the two algorithms.

Using the first-fit algorithm, for 500 bytes being the amount claimed,
the first-fit SLOB allocator had roughly 500k bytes free. We can see the
fragmentation by looking at the amount free being significantly higher
than the amount claimed. Meaning, our system on average is claiming a
new page when attempting to allocate 500 bytes, when we have 500k bytes
free. But due to the free list being highly fragmented, we can't use
those free bytes.

Using our best-fit algorithm, we run our system calls. For 500 bytes
claimed, the best-fit SLOB had roughly 300k bytes free. You can see
that there is still fragmentation, as is expected, but that the degree
of it was much less. The amount that is free is still much higher than
the amount we are trying to allocate.

When you compare the two sets of statistics, you can see that the best-
fit algorithm implementation reduced fragmentation by almost half.
The other major thing to consider between the two algorithms is the
speed difference. We expect the best-fit algorithm to be slower because
it ends up searching the entire list of pages much more often than the
first-fit algorithm does. For most functions (booting, file/folder
operations, etc), the speed difference is neglible. However, doing
an operation that will initiate many successive memory allocations
will significantly slow down the system. The best example of that
happening that we found was trying to compile the kernel from the best-
fit implementation.
